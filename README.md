# Aana Application Template

[Aana SDK](https://github.com/mobiusml/aana_sdk) is a powerful framework for building multimodal applications. It facilitates the large-scale deployment of machine learning models, including those for vision, audio, and language, and supports Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. This enables the development of advanced applications such as search engines, recommendation systems, and data insights platforms.

This repository contains a template that you can use to start building your own Aana application. It will help you get started with the Aana SDK and provide you with a basic structure for your application and its dependencies.

## How to use this template

1. Click on [Use this template](https://github.com/mobiusml/aana_app_template/generate).
2. Give your repository a name and click on "Create repository". The name of the repository will also be the name of your application and the Python package.
3. Wait for the first workflow to finish. This will rename the package to match the repository name.
4. Clone the repository to your local machine and start building your application.

## Getting started

The project template uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management. To install the project, run the following commands:

```bash
poetry install
```

See [Tutorial](https://github.com/mobiusml/aana_sdk/blob/main/docs/tutorial.md) for more information on how to build your application.
